# temporal_serie_prediction

Project for the Statistics and Optimization subject of the Master in Data Science. The main objective of the project is to perform an analysis of a time serie and be able to do a prediction.

## Serie

The series analyzed corresponds with the total spendings of foreign tourists in the Valencian Community, Spain. It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.epdata.es/datos/turistas-internacionales-comunidad-autonoma/68/comunidad-valenciana/299).

## Analysis and predictions

Different methodologies will be used, such as the Box-Jenkins or the Exponential smoothing. For the predictions, different options will be considered too. For example with Holtâˆ’Winters' additive method or fitting and ARIMA model to predict.
